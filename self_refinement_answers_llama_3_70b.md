| **Explanation 0** | "What does the error message `Error response from daemon: manifest for medicmobile/cht-haproxy:4.7.0-dependabot-npm-and-yarn-webapp-angular-b1a866d120.9137105888 not found: manifest unknown` mean? How can I resolve it?"<br>"What are possible reasons that a Docker image might not be found in a registry? How can I debug this issue?" | "Error response from daemon:... manifest unknown" | 1. The error message indicates that the specified Docker image is not found in the registry. This could be due to a typo in the image name, or the image may not exist in the registry. To resolve this, double-check the image name and ensure it exists in the registry. If the image is not found, you can try searching for the image in the registry or check if the image is available in a different registry. **2**. Possible reasons for a Docker image not being found in a registry include: (1) the image does not exist in the registry, (2) the image name is incorrect, (3) the registry is not accessible, or (4) the image is not publicly available. To debug this issue, you can try checking the registry for the image, verifying the image name, checking the registry's accessibility, or contacting the image owner for more information.  |
| **Explanation 1** | "What is causing the `ERESOLVE` dependency conflict error between `ttf-loader@1.0.2` and `file-loader@4.3.0`? How do I resolve the conflict between different versions of `file-loader` required by `ttf-loader` and other dependencies?"<br>"What are the potential solutions to fix a conflicting peer dependency in npm, specifically when the `ttf-loader` requires a different version of `file-loader` than what's installed in the project? What are the trade-offs of using `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps`?" | "tests/data/bids-examples/eeg_ds003645s_hed_demo has no issues ... FAILED (2ms)" | 1. The ERESOLVE dependency conflict error is caused by the ttf-loader@1.0.2 requiring a different version of file-loader (^1.1.6) than what's installed in the project (4.3.0). To resolve this conflict, you can try updating the ttf-loader to a version that is compatible with the installed file-loader version, or use the --force flag to force the installation of the required file-loader version. However, using --force can lead to unexpected behavior and is not recommended. A better approach is to use --legacy-peer-deps to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution, but this should be used with caution and thoroughly tested. **2** To fix a conflicting peer dependency in npm, you can try the following potential solutions: (1) update the dependency that requires the conflicting peer dependency to a version that is compatible with the installed peer dependency, (2) use --force to force the installation of the required peer dependency, (3) use --legacy-peer-deps to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution, or (4) remove the conflicting peer dependency and use a different dependency that does not require it. The trade-offs of using --force or --legacy-peer-deps include the risk of unexpected behavior, broken dependencies, and potential security vulnerabilities. |
| **Explanation 2** | "What steps can I take to resolve the `ERESOLVE` dependency conflict between `ttf-loader` and `file-loader` in npm?"<br>"When should I use the `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` flags in npm to resolve dependency conflicts, and what are the risks?" | "npm ERR! code ERESOLVE...the string \"Error response from daemon: manifest...\" was thrown" |1. To resolve the ERESOLVE dependency conflict between ttf-loader and file-loader, you can try the following steps: (1) update the ttf-loader to a version that is compatible with the installed file-loader version, (2) use the --force flag to force the installation of the required file-loader version, (3) use the --legacy-peer-deps flag to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution, or (4) remove the conflicting peer dependency and use a different dependency that does not require it. It is recommended to use the --force or --legacy-peer-deps flags only as a last resort, as they can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. **2**. The --force flag can be used to force the installation of a dependency that is not compatible with the installed version. However, this can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. The --legacy-peer-deps flag can be used to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution. This flag should be used with caution and only when necessary, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to use these flags only when you are aware of the potential risks and have thoroughly tested the dependencies. |
