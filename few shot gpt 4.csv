If your GitHub Actions workflow fails without clear error messages, here’s a quick guide to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Logs**:  
   Go to the **“Actions”** tab, select the failed workflow, and review the logs for any detailed errors.

2. **Enable Debug Logging**:  
   Add `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true` and `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true` to your workflow's `env:` section.

3. **Look at Recent Changes**:  
   Recent code or config changes might be causing the issue. Test or revert them if needed.

4. **Retry the Workflow**:

Failure Log: Error: .github#L1 a step cannot have both the `uses` and `run` keys

Root Cause: You cannot use both `uses` and `run` in the same step in a GitHub Actions YAML file.

- No tests are present
- Wrong test naming convention
- Tests are ignored by `.gitignore` or not committed

Check the image name and tag

Make sure the tag is correct. If it’s dynamically generated (like one based on a branch or hash), verify the build actually produced it.

On Docker Hub, go to the repository settings and switch it to public if it was meant to be public.

Root Cause: Docker tried to pull an image with a tag that doesn’t exist on Docker Hub.  
This commonly happens if:
- The tag was mistyped  
- The image hasn't been pushed yet  
- The image is private and inaccessible

Suggested Fix:  
- **Verify the image tag** exists on Docker Hub  
- If it’s dynamically generated, confirm that it was built and pushed beforehand  
- If it’s a private repo, make sure you're authenticated before pulling  
- Consider adding a fallback image/tag or validation check in the workflow","Failure Log:

##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.

Root Cause: Docker build failed due to a non-existent image tag in DockerHub.

Suggested Fix:  
Ensure that the Docker image `medicmobile/cht-haproxy:4.7.0-dependabot-npm-and-yarn-webapp-angular-b1a866d120.9137105888` exists.  
If it doesn't:
- Build and push the required image version  
- Or update the Docker tag in your workflow to a valid one

##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.

Root Cause: The test suite tried to interact with a UI element (`.sessionButton`) that never appeared,  
likely because the backend API route `/public/recipe/multitenancy/tenant/v2` returned 404 —  
meaning the service wasn't running or the endpoint was unavailable.

Suggested Fix:
- Make sure the SuperTokens backend is running and the route `/multitenancy/tenant/v2` is correctly deployed  
- Ensure the environment is fully initialized before running the test (e.g., use `wait-on` or similar tools)  
- Add retry logic or an explicit wait to give the server enough time to become ready","Failure Log:

##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.

Root Cause: The application failed to retrieve a resource from an API endpoint, returning 404 (Not Found).  
This likely indicates the test server wasn't fully initialized or the route wasn’t available yet.  
The UI test also failed because the `.sessionButton` selector never appeared — possibly due to the backend issue.

Suggested Fix:  
- Ensure the backend server is fully up before starting UI tests  
- Add retries or waits to confirm the service is healthy  
- Check the test environment for correct API deployment
