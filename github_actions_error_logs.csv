Error: .github#L1 a step cannot have both the `uses` and `run` keys,YAML Syntax / Workflow Definition Error,"This error comes from a malformed workflow step in your GitHub Actions YAML file — specifically at line 1 (as indicated by #L1). In a single step, you can either:

Use a predefined GitHub Action with the uses key
OR

Execute a custom shell command with the run key

You cannot combine both in one step.","Split this into two separate steps:

- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install"
Invalid workflow file: .github/worflows/broken-action-2.yml#L11 You have an error in your yaml syntax on line 11,YAML Syntax Error,"This means there’s a YAML syntax error on line 11 of your workflow file. YAML is whitespace- and indentation-sensitive, so even a small mistake can break the file. Common issues include:

Mixing tabs and spaces

Missing colons :

Unquoted strings with special characters

Incorrect indentation under jobs or steps","Steps to fix it:
Open .github/workflows/broken-action-2.yml

Go to line 11

Check for:

Missing colon : after a key

Misaligned indentation

Special characters (like : or #) in strings not wrapped in quotes"

Wrong test file naming

Misconfigured jest.config.js

Tests accidentally excluded (e.g., by .gitignore or missing in commit)","If your GitHub Actions workflow fails without clear error messages, here's a short answer to help you troubleshoot:

Check Logs:
Go to the ""Actions"" tab, select the failed workflow, and review the logs for error messages or step failures.
Enable Debug Logging:
Add ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true and ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true to your workflow's environment variables for detailed logs.
Look at Recent Changes:
If you've made recent changes, they could be causing the issue. Try reverting or re-testing those changes.
Retry the Workflow:
Sometimes, workflows fail due to temporary issues. Try running the workflow again to see if it resolves the problem."

Does not exist

Is private and requires authentication

Was mistyped or built locally but never pushed","Here are the steps to resolve it:

Check the image name and tag

Make sure the tag is correct. If it’s dynamically generated (like one based on a branch or hash), verify the build actually produced it.

Make the image public (if intended)

On Docker Hub, go to the repository settings and switch it to public if it was meant to be public.

Authenticate with Docker Hub (for private images)

Add secrets DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD to your repo

Authenticate before the build:

yaml

- name: Log in to Docker Hub
  run: echo ""${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}"" | docker login -u ""${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}"" --password-stdin
Push the image if it's missing
If the image tag is generated in a prior CI step, ensure it’s being built and pushed:

bash

docker build -t medicmobile/cht-haproxy:4.7.0-dependabot-npm-and-yarn-webapp-angular-b1a866d120.9137105888 .
