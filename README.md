# workflow_log_cleaner

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention for automating software debugging and log analysis, particularly in Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows. GitHub Actions (GA), a widely used CI/CD automation tool, generates complex and verbose failure logs, making debugging a time-consuming and error-prone task. Existing studies show that LLMs perform well in explaining simple errors but struggle with complex failure scenarios due to unstructured logs and inadequate reasoning capabilities. 

This research aims to enhance LLM-based analysis to improve CI/CD pipeline reliability by diagnosing failures more efficiently. This will be achieved through log preprocessing, prompt optimization, and analysis of the differences between unfiltered and preprocessed logs, followed by an evaluation of the results.
